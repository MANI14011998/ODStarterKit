# The OD Starter Kit

This layout is designed to help organizations distribute clean needles to heroin users who are at risk  for getting HIV/AIDS infection. It's a bit tongue and cheek but someone has to do it. Let's not forget kiddies that heroin was perfectly normal in the 1900s, and also that Coca Cola had cocaine in it! So before you castigate me for helping drug addicts, bear in mind that anything to excess is bad for you. So get off the damn sugar and start walking!
